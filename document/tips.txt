Key to debug

F5 	Goes to the next step in your program. If the next step is a method / function this command will jump into the associated code.
F6 	F6 will step over the call, e.g. it will call a method / function without entering the associated code.
F7 	F7 will go to the caller of the method/ function. So this will leave the current code and go to the calling code.
F8 	Use F8 to go to the next breakpoint. If no further breakpoint is encountered then the program will normally run.
